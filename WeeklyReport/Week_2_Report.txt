Name: Hayden Howard
Project Title: Annual Spending at National Parks based on weather

Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: Behind schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 6 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 12 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: Wrote my proposal document, began researching into how to make a web scrapper. I also emailed the National Parks organization to see if they already have the data in a clean format, but still waiting for a response. 


Challenges: Balances other course work to make time to research and begin the project.  


Plans / Goals for next week: Make time for the project to make valuable progress. Have a base web scrapper.  


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I only talked to my sister once this week about my project. I felt like I did not make enough progress to check in twice. 


Other comments: I know that the time commitment is not as important as producing a quality project. I am usually good at keeping up with course work, should I have my sister who I am having me stay accountable put due dates on my progress so it will be more of a priority.
