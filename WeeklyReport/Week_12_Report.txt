Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: slightly behind Schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 12 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 94 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: I made a machine learning model that got a good r squared score that I am okay with.
I also made all the three main visualizations and and descriptions and written responses to the questions they answered.
I began to work on some of the stretch requirements, I included the elevation and the size of the park in the dataset.



Challenges: No big challenges at the moment. 


Plans / Goals for next week: Work on two more stretch requirements. The interactive chart most likely will be a map.
The other stretch requirements is to make it into a website of some kind. This can be done by using a QMD file or I was also looking into using streamlit.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I was able to report to my sister this week and tell about the progress I have made. 

Other comments: After I make the interactive chart I just need to put everything together into one report. It feels good to be on the end stretch.
