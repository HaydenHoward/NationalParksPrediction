Name: Hayden Howard
Project Title: Annual Spending at National Parks based on weather

Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: Behind Schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 6 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 31 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: Read the PDF files and was able to get the data from them. Finished organizing the parks reports into csv per year.
I began looking into different ways to get the weather data. 



Challenges: I ran into an issue using the NOAA website to get the weather data. 


Plans / Goals for next week: Schedule more time for the project. Look into if I will still be able to use NOAA to get the weather data needed.
Use a web scrapper possibly to get this done. 


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I only talked to my sister once this week about my project. I was able to tell her what I had done and was planning to. She asked me if I was on schedule and was able to bounce a few ideas to her. 

Other comments: While I feel like I am behind schedule I only have one more "difficult" part left. The rest of the project 
should just be manipulate the data and trying to build a model for it. I have two weeks left before the requirement document is due so 
hopefully I will be able to complete this part before then to have a better understanding of what I will be able to do.
