Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: Close To Schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 8 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 25 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: Read the PDF files and was able to get the data from them. 



Challenges: Formatting the documents to be usable later. 


Plans / Goals for next week: Finish organizing the national parks data and begin gathering the weather data for it. 


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I only talked to my sister once this week about my project. I was able to tell her what I had done and was planning to. She asked me if I was on schedule and was able to bounce a few ideas to her. 

Other comments: I was able to get the data gathered but I messed up on removing some rows for the formatting and removed a row of data as well on a few of the years of data.
