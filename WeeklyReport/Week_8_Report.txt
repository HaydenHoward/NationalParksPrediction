Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: slightly behind Schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 6 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 62 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: I got to a good place with matching the national parks names from both data sets that they will now join together.




Challenges: At this moment I don't think there are any Challenges.


Plans / Goals for next week: Begin the exploring the data, and possible ML models to use.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I was able to report to my sister this week and tell about the progress I have made. 

Other comments: There are still a about 150 park names that I was not able to match with regex. I asked a friend that has experience working with data and 
a stats professor, Br. Saunders, on his opinions on the amount and the quality of the data if I were to leave these data entrees out of the data set. He said
that it should be fine since most of the parks that did not match are smaller national park types that I did not recognize, and to add a disclaimer to my report.
