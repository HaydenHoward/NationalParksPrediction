Accomplishments: I found some faults with the data so I had to go back and fix them.


Challenges: Just figuring out some more regex to clean the data to make it useable. 


Plans / Goals for next week: Exploring the data, and possible ML models to use.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I was able to report to my sister this week and tell about the progress I have made. 

Other comments: I was able to get the about 50 more parks to join with the data.
