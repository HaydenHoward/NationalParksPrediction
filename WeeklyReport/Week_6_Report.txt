Project Title: Annual Spending at National Parks based on weather

Team Members: Hayden Howard


Overall Status: Behind Schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 9 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 40 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:120 hours

Accomplishments: Used the National Park API to get the latitude, longitude, city, and postal code to add to the other national park data.
I looked into other ways to get the weather data besides NOAA such as the mesonet-api and open-weather-api but I am not sure at the moment what to 
continue with. I will continue through this weekend to figure this out.  



Challenges: I thought I had something when I got the latitude and longitude of the national parks
but st the moment I am not sure of a way to get the weather for the project. Within the mesonet api I was 
able to make a call and retrieve the data but i'm not what all of the data represents. I am able 
to get data from NOAA still but I am not sure how to automate this for the 350 plus national parks.


Plans / Goals for next week: Continue to figure out what to do with the weather data. Work on my SPED talk.
I am planning on going over the national park api or the tabula-py package to read data from a pdf.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?) I plan to report to my sister twice a week at the beginning and at the end to help talk through the processes I can try and report my findings.

I only talked to my sister once this week about my project. I was able to tell her what I had done and was planning to. She asked me if I was on schedule and was able to bounce a few ideas to her. 

Other comments: I think I am good for the Sped talk and After a little longer I will figure out the weather issue. I Am planning to work the the requirements document tomorrow after I look at the weather more.
